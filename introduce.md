Hello, my name is Zero, and I am 35 years old.

In the tech industry, many people may feel anxious when they reach 35, but for me, this age is not a problem. In fact, it’s a new beginning, after accumulating years of experience.

Let me briefly introduce myself in three areas: my development background, key achievements in Web3, and my future goals.

## Development Experience

Over the past 10+ years, I’ve worked in three areas: embedded C/C++ development, Web2 mobile internet, and Web3 blockchain.

* **Embedded & Desktop Development**: Gained deep knowledge of C/C++ and low-level technologies, which has helped me in smart contract design using Rust.
* **Web2 Mobile Development**: Transitioned into iOS development in 2015, working on projects such as shared bicycles and building full-stack skills with PHP, Golang, TypeScript, and mini-programs.
* **Web3 Blockchain**: Led the restructuring of a decentralized IM platform in 2023, gaining experience in both on-chain and off-chain system development.

## Key Web3 Achievements

1. **Cross-End Protocol Unification**: Developed a unified SDK for iOS, Android, and Web using Rust. *This shows my ability to quickly adapt and learn the tools needed to solve problems, focusing on what the problem requires rather than specific technologies.*

2. **Solana Contract Innovation**: Redesigned contract structures to bring off-chain price curves onto the blockchain. *This highlights my ability to quickly grasp new technologies and drive breakthroughs from the initial stages to full implementation.*

3. **Emergency Blockchain Scanner Rebuild**: Rebuilt the blockchain scanner in Golang during a critical time, ensuring the system was stable and functional before a pre-mint event. *This case demonstrates my ability to stay calm under pressure and deliver critical systems on time.*

## Future Goals

I plan to continue deepening my Web3 expertise and explore AI further. I am also practicing English speaking with ChatGPT to prepare for future international collaborations.

I’m excited about the possibility of bringing my skills and experience to new challenges and contributing to the success of your team.
